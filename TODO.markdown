Burden needs a rewrite this is everything i could think of that needs doing:

- [ ] Re add remember me
- [ ] Archive table
- [ ] Log ips/failed logins
- [ ] Reset password mechanism
- [ ] Switch to mysql PDO
- [ ] Add option to use US dates (mm/dd/yyyy)
- [ ] Add option to generate api keys, to be used for POST/cURL (expose tasks, create, delete)
- [ ] Improve security in task assignment (currently only id's are checked)
